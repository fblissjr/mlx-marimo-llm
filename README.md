# mlx-marimo-llm
Apple MLX LLMs - mlx-lm + marimo 

## quick usage info
- sunday kid activities starting so here's a quick usage guide:
- pip install mlx-lm (macos only)
- pip install marimo
- change your model directory (using llama3 here but you could use anything)
- add your serp api key
- marimo edit marimo-serplexity.py (opens a browser to edit)
- may overwhelm and crash your system given the text gen volume. to be worked on, unless someone else gets to it before me
- UI is very very raw and not even close to what a good marimo app should look like
- marimo is fantastic. please give it a try - marimo.io
